            For what I think is a really underrated game, I chose <b>Metaphor Re:Fantazio.</b> This game I do
            was realeased in 2024 and understand that this game it is <b>HIGHLY</b> praised. Out of 100 game critcs
            scored it in the 90s and the common player base scored it above the 80s, it even got a game of
            the year nomination. So I should say this game isn&apos;t underrated but instead undisscussed.

          <h3>Why I think it should be talked about more</h3>
          <p>
             When Atlus first revealed <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i>, it immeditly got the 
             attention of longtime fans, myself included. It has a beautiful art style, 
             it is a brand-new IP from the creative minds behind Persona 3, 4, and 5, and
             the story is one of the most well written I've ever experienced in gaming.
             That should have been headline-dominating news across the gaming world.
          </p>

          <p>
            And while it did get a decent amount of attention I feel as though it should&apos;ve 
            been talked about more. Mainly because of two reasons its message and story.
            As a short summary <i>Metaphor: ReFantazio</i>, follows a young protagonist in a divided fantasy kingdom 
            who enters a royal tournament to determine the next ruler after the king&apos;s death. 
            Along the way, he confronts deep-rooted prejudice, class inequality, and political 
            corruption embedded in society. This is very suface level but it goes much deeper about 
            going against coruption, grief, and self acceptance.
          </p>

                Full of material ideas about race, class, and society that are all 
                too necessary in our tumultuous times, Metaphor is an experience that 
                stays with you long past the credits.

          <p>
           After Persona 5 exploded into mainstream success, Atlus cemented itself as 
           one of the most respected RPG developers in modern gaming. But success can
           be a double-edged sword. When a studio creates something massively popular, 
           every future project gets compared to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of being discussed as its own identity, Metaphor: ReFantazio is 
            often reduced to “the fantasy Persona.” That label limits it. It frames 
            the game as an offshoot rather than what it actually is: a completely new 
            universe with different themes, mechanics, and narrative ambitions. When 
            people only measure it against Persona, they miss what makes it unique.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h3>Depth Isn&apos;t Always Mainstream-Friendly</h3>

          <p>
            Atlus games aren not lightweight experiences. They&apos;re dense, stylish,
            and mechanically layered. Often long and demanding. That depth is part of 
            their brilliance—but it can also limit accessibility. Not everyone is ready 
            to commit 70 to 100 hours to a story-heavy, system-rich RPG. Because of that, 
            Metaphor: ReFantazio may naturally appeal to a more niche audience, at least 
            initially. And in the world of gaming discourse, niche acclaim does not always 
            translate to widespread recognition.
          </p>
          <br>
          
          
          <h3>The Turn-Based Bias</h3>
           
         
          <p>
              One of the biggest (and most overlooked) reasons Metaphor: ReFantazio doesn not 
              get discussed more is its turn-based combat. While turn-based systems are 
              beloved within the JRPG community, mainstream gaming trends have shifted 
              heavily toward real-time, action-oriented combat. Flashy gameplay, cinematic 
              boss fights, and fast-paced mechanics tend to dominate majority of peoples interest and
              streaming platforms.

                Hope is only a step behind a clear conscious
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>—Atlus, <cite>Metaphor: ReFantazio </cite></p>
            </div>
          <p>
            Turn-based gameplay, on the other hand, is more strategic and methodical and
            it does not always produce viral moments. It requires patience and planning 
            rather than reflexes. For some players, that immediately makes it feel 
            “old-fashioned,” even though modern turn-based systems, especiallythose of Atlus, are 
            deeply refined and stylish. Because of that perception, some gamers dismiss the 
            title before even engaging with its systems. And when fewer people jump in, 
            fewer large-scale conversations follow.
          </p>
          

          <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
          

          <p>
           Between living in the shadow of Persona, embracing turn-based combat in an 
           action dominated era, and having a deep and heavy story that need commitment, 
           Metaphor: ReFantazio faces uphill battles when it comes to mainstream recognition.
           But sometimes the most ambitious games are not the loudest, they&apos;re the 
           ones that quietly build loyal audiences and lasting impact.
