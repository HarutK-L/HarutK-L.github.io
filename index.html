            Hello everyone! My name is Harut Kulakchian and this is my video game blog website. I was tasked
            to make a website of anything I wanted and I decided to make my website about video games
            I've played in the past. I chose video games because I love playing them and  I've played
            them for most of my life. I am going to talk about my favorite game as well as what I think
            is a over-rated and a under-rated game.
          </p>
       
          <h3>My history with games</h3>
          <p>
            As far as I can remember I've played video games, in fact I've been playing games for what I believe to 
            be almost two decades at this point. I can still remeber my first console being the gamecube
            and now I'm playing on the PS5 and my laptop. I've also played many different genres 
            of games so I like to believe that I have enough experince to have opinions on theses games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of my most memorable games of all time include <i>Mario Kart Double Dash</i> since I have memories of me and 
            my brother playing it together. I also enjoyed the <i>Skylanders Series</i> as kid since thought the whole toy 
            mechanic was really amazing. As I grew older, I also started to lean more towards action and fantasy games as I 
            enjoyed them gameplay and aesthetic wise. Some Favorites I would like to mention are <i>God of War series</i>, <i>The Persona series</i>,
            <i>Elden Ring</i>, and <i>Evolve</i>.
          </p>

            <h3>God of War</h3>
          <p>
           The <i>God of war</i>series has always been one of my most favorite game series and has a 
           huge following in the gaming community and for good reason.The God of War series starts 
           as a rage-fueled revenge story set in Greek mythology. Kratos, a Spartan warrior tricked 
           into killing his own family by Ares, declares war on the gods and tears through Olympus 
           in brutal, over-the-top battles. The early games are packed with massive boss fights and 
           nonstop action, but at their core they tell a tragic story about a man consumed by vengeance
           who ultimately brings down the entire Greek pantheon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Norse saga takes a more emotional turn. An older Kratos is now a father to Atreus, trying 
            to leave his violent past behind while navigating a world of Norse gods like Baldur, Thor, and Odin. 
            The combat is still intense, but the focus shifts to fatherhood, grief, and redemption, showing a 
            more thoughtful and human side of Kratos.

          <h3>Elden Ring</h3>

          </figure>
          <p>
           <i>Elden Ring</i> won game of the year for 2022 and it is a well deserved award.
           <i>Elden Ring</i>feels like stepping into a broken world and slowly piecing it 
           together through blood, patience, and pure stubbornness. The games takes place in the 
           Lands Between whisch is broken after the Elden Ring is destroyed, and demigods—each twisted 
           by power and ambition—fight over its fragments. As a Tarnished, you&apos;re called 
           back to this dying world with one goal: rise up, claim the Great Runes, and 
           become Elden Lord. The world is massive and mysterious, packed with terrifying 
           bosses, each one feeling like a wall you&apos;re not supposed to overcome—until you do.
          </p>
          <p>
           What makes it unforgettable is the freedom and atmosphere. You&apos;re not just following
           a path; you&apos;re freely exploring haunting castles, poisoned swamps, underground 
           cities, and golden fields hiding unimaginable horrors. The story is cryptic, told through 
           fragments and lore, but that only makes uncovering it feel more rewarding. It&apos;s brutal,
           fun, and keeps knocking you down, which makes actually beating it much more rewarding.

          <h3>Persona</h3> <!-- figure element-->

          </figure>
          <p>
            For the <i>Persona</i> series all of the games have thier own story and world building
            but truth be told I couldn&apos;t pick one to put here mainly cause I love 
            all of the games that much. I alos know a lot of people just can&apos;t enjoy a 
            turn-based game but honestly I really it for it&apos;s tactical feel and rewarding build crafting.
            This series is this perfect mix of that stylish turn-based combat, 
            deep social storytelling, and supernatural mystery that somehow just works. 
            On the surface, you&apos;re a high school student balancing classes, friendships, 
            and exams—but underneath that normal life is a hidden world where shadows
            lurk and Personas, manifestations of the self, are summoned to fight back. 
            Whether it&apos;s the eerie midnight TV world of <i>Persona 4</i> , or the rebellious Phantom
            Thieves changing corrupt hearts in <i>Persona 5</i>, each game blends dungeon crawling 
            with deeply personal character arcs.
          </p>
          <p>
             What really makes the series special are the casts story and the music. Building bonds with friends
             isn&apos;t just optional—it makes you stronger in battle, tying emotional growth directly 
             to gameplay. The soundtracks are unforgettable, the art style drips with personality, 
             and every entry tackles heavy themes like death, truth, and rebellion in a 
             way that feels surprisingly real. It&apos;s endings are also very hevy and emotinal,
             it&apos;s always a mix of satisfaction and melencholy that ties up the story nicely
             while also making the long journey came to an end.

          <h3>Evolve</h3> <!-- figure element-->
           <figure>
            <img
                src="images/Evolve.png"
                alt="Evolve"

              />
              <figcaption>Evolve (2015)</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            <i>Evolve</i> was one of the coolest games I&apos;ve ever played, four
            hunters versus one player-controlled monster in a massive, hostile alien 
            wilderness. This game is special to me, came out while I was in middle school 
            and it took up a lot of my time. It was also through this game that I met some of my closest 
            friends i know today so I owe it a lot. The hunters each had unique roles, and teamwork was everything if you 
            wanted to track down and stop the monster before it evolved into something 
            unstoppable. Meanwhile, the monster player was basically living out their monster
            fantasy by sneaking around, eating wildlife to grow stronger, and 
            eventually turning the tables in a full-blown, chaotic showdown.
          </p>

          <p>
            What made <i>Evolve</i> special was the tension. Every match felt different, in each match you&apos;r
            tracking moments suddenly exploding into frantic, ability-filled battles. The monsters 
             all had distinct playstyles, and when the game clicked, it was insanely fun. Unfortuneatly
             it had its issues and didn&apos;t last as long as it deserved partly due to bad buisness
             practices, but there a large group of fans that still remember it and want it to come back, myself included,
             because honsetly this game was way ahead of its time.
